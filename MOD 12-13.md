- Not all data that is available on the internet is OSINT.
- That data becomes OSINT when it is retrieved or applied to a specific purpose.

### Online and Local Search Tools

#### _IntelligenceX
- _IntelligenceX brings several search engines and tools together under one website in an organized manner to conduct OSINT queries.
- _IntelligenceX performs searches using specific search terms (or selectors) including:
  - Email addresses
  - Domains
  - Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
  - IP
  - Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
  - Bitcoin addresses
  - InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) hashes
- Searches occur in multiple locations such as:
  - Darknet: A form of internet overlay networks that can only be accessed with special software, settings, or authorization; often employs a custom communication protocol
  - Document sharing platforms
  - WHOIS dataPublic data leaks

#### Shodan
- Shodan is a search engine, but not for websites. It was built to search for internet-connected devices such as webcams, voice controllers, home security systems, etc.
- It can be used to search for devices using **default/generic credentials**, for **indicators of files or directories unique to a specific device**, **database**, **VoIP** product, or **webcam**.
