## OSINT Techniques

### Overview of OSINT
![12354486-84e4-4401-975d-81ad1349ef53](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5ee17f4-a54e-4b26-9bc9-bef4492cebd4)

- **OSINT** is gathering publicly-available data for use as intelligence in a specific operation or investigative purpose.
- Not all data that is available on the internet is OSINT.
- That data becomes OSINT when it is retrieved or applied to a specific purpose.

#### OSINT Framework

### Online and Local Search Tools
#### _IntelligenceX
- _IntelligenceX brings several search engines and tools together under one website in an organized manner to conduct OSINT queries.
- _IntelligenceX performs searches using specific search terms (or selectors) including:
  - Email addresses
  - Domains
  - Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
  - IP
  - Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
  - Bitcoin addresses
  - InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) hashes
- Searches occur in multiple locations such as:
  - Darknet: A form of internet overlay networks that can only be accessed with special software, settings, or authorization; often employs a custom communication protocol
  - Document sharing platforms
  - WHOIS dataPublic data leaks

#### Shodan
- Shodan is a search engine, but not for websites. It was built to search for internet-connected devices such as webcams, voice controllers, home security systems, etc.
- It can be used to search for devices using **default/generic credentials**, for **indicators of files or directories unique to a specific device**, **database**, **VoIP** product, or **webcam**.

### Social Media
#### Gramho
- Gramho analyzes Instagram accounts to provide statistics and compare it to others users.
- The predictability algorithm provides feedback on the account’s popularity.
- It also allows exploration and monitoring of user account anonymously.
- This can be used to analyze Instagram accounts and even extract the original images or videos from the accounts.
- Screenshots or screen recordings may not capture the image with full fidelity.

#### Social Bearing
- Social Bearing is intended for brand and market research, but can be used to find links, images, videos, and even geolocation on certain topics.
- Any website or application trying to access a Twitter stream or endpoint must first authenticate with the new API.
- Application and user authentication are the two forms of Twitter API authentication.
  - Both methods of authentication necessitate the use of access keys, which Twitter uses to monitor endpoint use and combat spam.
- A Twitter login is required to complete some searches using Social Bearing.
- Twitter phased out access to their old Application Programming Interface (API), which has been replaced by a new API.
  - Any website or application trying to access a Twitter stream or endpoint must first authenticate with the new API.

### DNS Data
- DNS data provides multiple types of OSINT and various tools to help you obtain it.

#### DNSDumpster
- DNSDumpster is employed to find hosts related to a desired domain.
- For an attacker’s perspective, locating visible hosts is a vital part of security assessment.
- Being able to quickly discover, map, and visualize the domain's attack surface is beneficial for OSINT.
- This may be used to discover weak points in the attack surface. Weak points may include old servers or forgotten web applications/servers
- OSINT of this type is useful to CPT members to identify terrain in mission partner systems that are exposed to the internet in unknown or unforeseen ways.

### Recon-ng
- Recon-ng is a reconnaissance framework designed to provide a complex environment for conducting open-source, web-based reconnaissance rapidly.
- However, Recon-ng performs web-based recon naissance  exclusively, so it is not intended to compete with Metasploit.
- This tool installs locally on a computer and runs from there, so all queries/requests are coming from the computer rather than a search engine
- The Interesting File Finder checks multiple hosts for interesting files in predictable locations.
  - An interesting file is a file containing environmental data, metadata, or configuration information not normally linked from another web page, however, it is stored in a location that is publicly accessible

### theHarvester
- theHarvester is a powerful tool for gathering OSINT.
  - Specifically, it gathers information associated with provided **names**, **emails**, **domains**, **IPs**, and **URLs** from various public data sources like **Google** or **LinkedIn**.

### TinEye
- TinEye is a reverse image search.
  - It uses **pattern recognition**, **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **neural networks** to search for any uploaded image.
- Reverse image searches are also commonly used to identify potential spearphishing attempts, particularly over social media.

### Google Hacking
#### Google Hacking Database (GHDB)

- GHDB is a repository of search filters used on Google (and other search engines) to search for interesting and/or sensitive information
- It is hosted on Offensive Security’s Exploit Database website
-_ Google dorking_ uses the Google search engine’s innate abilities to locate various file types and webpages using specific search strings.
  - A device that is connected to the internet is all that is required to execute these searches.

### Data Visualization
#### OSINT Combine

- OSINT Combine provides quick data visualization from local .csv files.
- The visualization is populated directly in the browser without needing third-party tools.
- As you load .csv files, it continuously adds the information to the network diagram.
- All data is managed from the client side; no information is processed through OSINT Combine servers.
- One example of using OSINT Combine is through domain name enumeration
