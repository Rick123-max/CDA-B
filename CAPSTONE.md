## DDOS Attacks & Defenses
### What is a DoS/DDoS Attack?
- _The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) defines a DoS Attack as an attack that has occurred when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor._
- This loss of access can range from a **single service or machine** being inaccessible, up to an entire network.
- There are many different categories of DoS attacks, each with their own characteristics and varying degrees of impact.
- A **DDoS** attack is the same as a DoS, but is launched from **more than one attacker-controlled host**.
- Hosts used in a DDoS might be a from a large amount of attackers coordinating their attack, or from an army of unwitting bots under the control of a single attacker.
